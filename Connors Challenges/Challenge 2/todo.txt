TODO:
Dockerize

This challenge may need tweaked for RMU's lab and for docker. The challenge involves sending specific packets to the user, but my implementation may be flawed. I believe that when the program is dockerized, some aspect of docker acts as a middleman in network communications. This means the packets that the user needs to solve the problem are first sent to Docker, and Docker drops the packets.

If you're hosting the problem yourself and are struggling to confirm the challenge is even working, talk to/email Connor at cjqst262@mail.rmu.edu
