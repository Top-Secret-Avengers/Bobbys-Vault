This challenge can be hosted blindly without spoiling the flag.

Step 0: Make sure Python 3 is downloaded on the machine you're hosting the challenge from

Step 1: Download ctf.py without opening the file

Step 2: Navigate to the directory you downloaded the file to with your terminal

Step 3: Launch ctf.py with the command "python3 ctf.py {PORT}" where PORT is any port number of your choice

That's all there is to hosting. If you're still experiencing problems with this challenge, view the todo file. There's a chance your network configuration may be blocking the necessary communications from the server.
