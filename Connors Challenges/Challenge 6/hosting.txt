TODO: Write these instructions for linux. Currently, instructions are for Windows Powershell

This challenge has been dockerized. To host it:

Step 0: Install docker

Step 1: Download minecraft-server.tar (docker image)

Step 2: Navigate to it in Powershell

Step 3: Run the following command to load the image
docker load --input .\minecraft-server.tar

Step 4: Run the following command to run the image on port 25565
docker run -d -p 25565:25565 --restart unless-stopped --name minecraft-server minecraft-server

Step 5: Open docker desktop and look at it

If for whatever reason you can't make the docker image load, the Challenge 6 folder also has all of the necessary files to build the docker image.

To build the image:

Step 1: Download all of the files in the "Files for Image" folder and put them in the same folder

Step 2: Navigate to that folder in Powershell and run the following command
docker build -t minecraft-server .

Step 3: Run the following command to run the image on port 25565
docker run -d -p 25565:25565 --restart unless-stopped --name minecraft-server minecraft-server

If you're interested in seeing the solution to the challenge, I've included my chicken scratch master dock in the Challenge 6 folder as well. Remember, reading it will spoil the challenge.
