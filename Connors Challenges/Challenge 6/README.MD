This challenge is a minecraft java server. The challenge host will provide you with the server's IP and port (and potentially minecraft account if you don't have one).
This server is hosted on Linux machine. On the Linux machine, in the same directory as the minecraft_server.jar file, there is a file called "flag.txt". If you can believe it, this file contains the flag.
As far as I know, you will need to be on the Minecraft server to solve this challenge.

For information on how to host the server, check out hosting.txt

This challenge is Nearly Impossible
