This challenge doesn't have it's own flag. Instead, it has a few questions to answer stored in "x questions.txt". Download x.gci to answer them.

With how the questions are formatted, seeing question #4 would spoil the answer for questions 1-3. Make sure that you only scroll down to question 2 in the txt document once you answered question 1.

This challenge has a research approach and a much different approach. It's Medium/Hard, depending on which you choose.
